## üíæ Installation <a id="installation"></a>

Start by cloning the code from the GitHub repository. Then run ```git clone <clone link>``` in your terminal in a chosen directory. This application will need node and npm installed.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage <a id="usage"></a>


To make your own high-quality svg logo:

You can initialize this application in a code editor, e.g., VS Code, by opening the cloned repository and running ```node index.js``` in the editor's terminal window.

You can also run the same command ```node index.js``` in your desktop's terminal, as long as you are in the repository's directory.

The application will run through a series of prompts where you will choose some details for your logo. You will need to use at least 1 character but no more than 3 for the content of the logo. Using a color keyword or hex code for picking the color of your text and of your shape is available. There is a choice of Square, Circle, or Triangle for the base shape of it all.

Once completing all the prompts, a file named logo.svg will be created in the dist directory. It will also log that it has been created in the console.

This application was made to be used again and again, but the logo.svg file will be written over with the new responses each time. So be sure to save it to another directory, or with another name if you'd like to keep it.
